                            <p class=""><em>If you are looking for the best, stop looking and hire LX Photography! We hired Eddie and Katerina before anything else was decided -we had worked with them previously and loved their professionalism, creativity, and how comfortable they made us feel in front of the camera. We would have changed the date of our wedding in order to have them as our photographers! They are an amazing team with different, yet complimentary, eyes for photography. Their combined styles make for a very unique set of photos that tell a beautiful story! We had a lot of expectations riding on their photography skills, but because we had the confidence in them from the beginning, we felt very comfortable allowing them to be creative geniuses during our wedding day on April 22, 2017. On the actual wedding day they were incredible - allowing us to take our time with everything and have moments to ourselves, yet they still managing to capture every important moment of the wedding and ceremony in the most magical way. Eddie and Katerina also went above and beyond their call of duty to make sure that were prepared for the wedding day: they spent several hours with us prior to walking down the aisle making sure that we knew exactly what to expect; they visited the venue ahead of time so that they knew what to expect; they worked flawlessly with our other vendors, especially our wedding coordinator; they played the role of guardian for me on the wedding day making sure that I was sheltered from any and all “issues”; they allowed for plenty of time in the timeline for photos so that neither of us felt rushed (with a little extra time for the bride); and they stayed until the end of the night even though they were not obligated to! My husband and I are in love with our photos, and we have amazing memories of the wedding day, many of which are thanks to Eddie and Katerina!</em></p>
