            <p class="text-12em">Does the way you present yourself in your social media, on your website, your blog or in magazines speak of who you are and what you are selling? Is your personal image a big part of your brand?</p>
            <p class="text-12em">Communicating with your potential clients can be challenging, especially if they first meet you through a screen. That is why high quality images that create an emotional connection and let them see what it feels like to work with you are highly important to warm welcome your potential clients and start building trust.</p>
            <p class="text-12em">In a Personal Branding shoot, we work together to create images that reflect and strengthen your message, that can be used across all social and print media to grow your business, bring extra impact and personality to entrepreneurial marketing projects.</p>
            <p class="text-12em">Our Shoot Concept consultation  will help you to communicate what you would like to bring out in your portraits – the colors, expressions, poses, items – everything that will help you tell your story.</p>
            <p class="text-12em">We also discuss what image formats would better suit your needs – verticals, horizontals, negative space for text, etc.</p>
            <p class="text-12em">Things have changed, no longer is a ‘selfie’ good enough to have on your website and social media. Set yourself apart from your competition and create an emotional connection between you and your customer.</p>
            <p class="text-12em">Contact me to request more information.  I would love to hear about your business and how you would love to be photographed!</p>
