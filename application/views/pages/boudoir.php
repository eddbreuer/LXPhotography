                            <p><em>…Investing in yourself, stepping out of your comfort zone, and seeing yourself through somebody else’s eyes (and lens) can be truly life changing for women who doubt their beauty, body image and self-confidence. I want to evoke emotion and feeling in your photographs to create that TEASING THE SENSES vibe!<br>My signature style is BLACK & WHITE. Black and White photographs always hold an affectionate place in my heart. They have an incomparable mystique and mood. There is something empowering in Black & White imagery.</p>
                            <p class="">COLOR IS EVERYTHING, BLACK AND WHITE IS MORE.</em></p>

                            <p><em>For me, boudoir is loving and accepting yourself, just as you are right now. I like to let my photos do most of the talking (they have a sexier accent).<br>My clients come to me when they have just lost a significant amount of weight, when they are getting married and want to feel sexy for their fiancée, or when they have just gotten out of a relationship and want to feel wanted and beautiful again. But above most of all, they come to gain back that self-confidence they think they lost. You may tell me it’s a gift to your significant other, but truly, the experience is for YOU.</p>
                            <p class="">Your boudoir session with me will be fun and 100% all about you. I am here for you every step of the way to make this experience enjoyable!</em></p>
